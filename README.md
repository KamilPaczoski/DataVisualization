This Python repository is dedicated to data analysis using various packages, including pandas, matplotlib, numpy, cufflinks, numpy_financial, dash, and dash_html_components.

It comprises multiple smaller Jupyter notebook files designed for incremental learning and practice. These notebooks consist of exercises aimed at building familiarity with the tools.

In addition to the exercises, the repository contains a more substantial project titled "ProjektDashboard." This project serves as a practical application of the skills acquired through the exercises. 

The focus is on demonstrating proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and financial computations using the specified Python packages.

The repository provides a structured progression from basic exercises to a more comprehensive project, showcasing the incremental development of skills in data analysis.
